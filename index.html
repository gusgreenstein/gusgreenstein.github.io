  <h1>Gus Greenstein</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Assistant Professor of Public Policy and Administration<br>
    Leiden University Institute of Public Administration<br>
    Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs
  </p>

  <p>I'm a political scientist specializing in environmental governance, public administration, and policy studies, working as an Assistant Professor of Public Policy and Administration at the Leiden University Institute of Public Administration (Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs). I received my PhD from Stanford University's Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.</p>

  <p>Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, I study policy implementation and institutional change in the context of environmental/climate policy and international development. My work on policy implementation examines how organizational structure and management practice affect the outputs and performance of public agencies, and the factors that shape agency structure and management. My work on institutional change explores the drivers of environmental policy change in national/subnational governments and international development organizations.</p>

  <p>My completed and active projects address these themes in the context of deforestation control in Brazil, forest regulations (in global comparative perspective), World Bank environmental policy, and the allocation of development finance in USAID, among other areas.</p>

  <p>I currently serve on the Steering Committee of the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) Standing Group on Environmental Politics. I'm a Research Fellow of the Earth Systems Governance Project and former Research Fellow at the School for Advanced International Studies (SAIS), Johns Hopkins University.</p>

  <p>Outside of academia, I've consulted for the World Bank Environment Practice, World Bank Independent Evaluation Group, and Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL). I've worked as a Research Analyst for The Brattle Group (an energy economics consulting firm), International Rivers, and Conservation Strategy Fund. As a Thomas Watson Fellow, I spent a year documenting the social-environmental impacts of large hydropower projects across South/Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America.</p>

  <p>I hold an MPhil in Development Studies from Oxford and a BA in Environmental Studies from Amherst College.</p>
